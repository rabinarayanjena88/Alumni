        Maharaja Purna Chandra Bhanj Deo, in whose loving memory, this college is named and built by His son Maharaja Pratap Chandra Bhanj Deo, was a great patron of literature and culture. Maharaja Pratap Chandra formed this college in 1948 at the MKC High School and then due to non-availabilty of space and increase in students, the college was shifted to the Palace of Maharaja. The college was shifted to its own building at Takhatpur in the year of 2001 and started functioning there till date.
